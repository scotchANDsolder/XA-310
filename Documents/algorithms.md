## Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems. 
Algorithms were originally born as part of mathematics, infact the word “algorithm” comes from the Arabic mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar [Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi), – 
but currently the word is strongly associated with computer science.

##### Think about an algorithm to describe the action of consuming a bowl of cereal:

- Find a bowl
- Find cereal
- Pour cereal into the bowl
- Pour milk onto cereal
- Acquire a spoon
- Consume cereal

This is a simple series of steps to perform a task. However, there are many steps omitted for clarity:

- Where do you get the bowl?
- What if there are no clean bowls?
- Where is the cereal stored? How do you open the container? What if there isn't any left? What if there is enough for only half a bowl?
- Where are the spoons? What if there are several sizes available?

These details are abstracted away in order to focus on the general procedures; in real world implementations all of these details and _possible scenarios and errors must be accounted for and documented._


## Searching & Sorting Algorithms

One frequent task in developing computer programs is to _look_ for certain types of data i.e. Searching and putting the data in _organized_ structures i.e. Sorting.
