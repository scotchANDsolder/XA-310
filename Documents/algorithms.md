## Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems. 
Algorithms were originally born as part of mathematics, infact the word “algorithm” comes from the Arabic mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar [Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi), – 
but currently the word is strongly associated with computer science.
