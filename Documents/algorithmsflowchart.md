# Algorithms & Flowcharts

We have already looked what algorithms are and what they do. Sometimes to get started with creating our own algorithms it can be helpful in creating a visual representations of 
decisions, processes etc. that are assumed in an algorithm. These visualizations are called Flowcharts amd they can be used to develop programs. 
An algorithm is a step-by-step analysis of the process, while a flowchart explains the steps of a program in a graphical way.


For example: 
#### Print 1 to 20:
- **Algorithm**:
  - Step 1: Initialize X as 0,
  - Step 2: Increment X by 1,
  - Step 3: Print X,
  - Step 4: If X is less than 20 then go back to step 2.
- **Flowchart**:
