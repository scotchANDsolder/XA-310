# Algorithms & Flowcharts

We have already looked what algorithms are and what they do. Sometimes to get started with creating our own algorithms it can be helpful in creating a visual representations of 
decisions, processes etc. that are assumed in an algorithm. These visualizations are called Flowcharts amd they can be used to develop programs. 
An algorithm is a step-by-step analysis of the process, while a flowchart explains the steps of a program in a graphical way.


For example: 
#### Print 1 to 20:
- **Algorithm**:
  - Step 1: Initialize X as 0,
  - Step 2: Increment X by 1,
  - Step 3: Print X,
  - Step 4: If X is less than 20 then go back to step 2.
- **Flowchart**:

### Level of detail

How do you get from a complex task to an organized flowchart describing how to do it? 

Start with a flowchart containing just the task. Now break it down into smaller, more specific steps in another flowchart. Then, go back
and see if you can break down any of those behaviors into simpler parts. Keep on repeating this process until you’ve
reached steps that are simple enough for your robot to perform!
