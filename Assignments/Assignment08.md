# Sorting Algorithms

DUE 3/23 Before class

For this assignment, you will need to pick any two (other that bubble sort) JavaScript sorting algorithm, implement it successfully, and describe how what the algorithm is actually doing.

#### Requirements
Download this starter file and rename it to use your last name, in lowercase:
- [lastname_08.zip](https://github.com/scotchANDsolder/XA-310/raw/main/CodeFiles/lastname_08.zip)

In the index.html file, there is code to create three arrays of random numbers:

1. smallArray, with 100 numbers
2. mediumArray, with 1000 numbers
3. largeArray, with 10000 numbers

Find 2 different common sorting algorithms - other than bubble sort - and get the code working in the HTML file. Then use the console.time() and console.timeEnd() tools to measure their performance.

#### Writing
Create a PDF and explain the following:

- What are the names of your algorithm that you used?
- In your own words, how does each of them actually work? How is it doing the sorting? Describe it in plain english. You may draw images/diagrams if it is helpful. 
- Where did you find an implementation to guide you? (Please list any URLs)
- What is each algorithm's Big O notation?
- What did you observe your each algorithm's performance compared to bubble sort? How did the performance change with different input sizes? Are your algorithms faster? Or slower? Why?


#### Submitting Your Work
To turn in your work, submit a zipped version of your renamed folder to D2L by the due date.
