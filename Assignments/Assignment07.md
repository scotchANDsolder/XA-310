    - “Starting at the Broad Museum, follow Grand River Avenue west for 2 miles, then take a left turn onto Highland Street. Go until you reach the bridge, but don’t cross the bridge. Instead, make a right turn onto Foster Street, then take the first left turn. 
    Follow that road until you reach the Red Cedar Park.”
7.  Create a flowchart that determines how to appropriately assigns a person to one of the following categories.
