### Overview
*What Is Computational Thinking*?

From Wikipedia:

> By one of the many definitions, computational thinking is the thought process involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution(s) in such a way that a computer---human or machine---can effectively carry out.

 Another characterization of computational thinking is an iterative process based on three stages:

- Abstraction: Problem formulation;
- Automation: Solution expression;
- Analyses: Solution execution and evaluation.

And a quote attributed to someone named "John Johnson":

> First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.

In other words...*Work the solution out on paper in steps, then start writing the code for it. Don't get tangled in the code and software design.*

Computational thinking is a method for problem solving that uses ideas fundamental to computing, such as reducing complex ideas to simpler tasks, collecting and analyzing data, and providing detailed instructions for performing tasks that can be applied broadly to future problems.

The fundamental elements of this process include:

- **Decomposition** - breaking down a complex problem into smaller parts.
- **Pattern Recognition** - finding regularities, shared traits, similarities, or irregularities in sets of data.
- **Abstraction** - reducing complexities or synthesizing facts gathered from data into a broader, more general idea.
- **Algorithims** - creating a set or rules or instructions for solving the problem.

While this course will use computer programs, it is not necessarily a computer programming class. Computational thinking is **conceptualization**, and starts before writing any code.

That said, we will use computers and programming languages to express some of these concepts. We will also explore how computers work and operate, how various computing languages differ and why different ones are used for different purposes, and to begin to think about how to interact with computers in ways that combine things that computers are good at with things that humans are good at while understanding the limitations of both.

### Course Modality

The first 3 weeks of this course (until Jan 26th) will be held online. Please see D2L for details of the Zoom classroom. We will then transition to the following format:

 - Each Monday will be a 'recitation' day; I will be available via Zoom during class time for office hours, questions, feedback, and help with work. Attendance will NOT be required on Mondays
 - Each Wednesday will be in-person (Bessy Hall 317) and on campus. These days will when student presentations occur, and will allow for in-person meeting and discussion. Attendance WILL be required on Wednesdays

### Class Materials
There is no required text for this course; any readings will be provided as needed. Course materials will be available as follows:

- The course syllabus, lecture materials, class schedules, and assignments overviews will be available on the course website Github
- D2L will be used for assignment submission and grading

You will require access to a computer - Mac or PC - with internet access and the ability to install and configure software. You will also require a text editor of some sort; there are many freely available.

Finally, you must ensure that you have access to your files at all times in all places, and to maintain backups. Use a flash drive, cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, One Drive), or some combination to ensure that you don't lose your work. Losing your files is not a valid excuse in this day and age of ubiquitous online storage.

### Attendance
To be successful in this class you must participate, read, and write code and markup.

It is expected that students will attend class in-person regularly. However, sometimes, real life interferes. As such, students can miss two course meetings with no grading penalty. Beyond two course absences, however, 5% will be deducted from your class participation grade for each missed class (without a very good excuse, preferably pre-arranged).

Absences due to Covid - sickness, having to be isolated based on exposure, etc. - will be handled separately and will not count against your absence total.

### Assignments
Course assignments will focus on programming tasks well as conceptual work that expresses ideas or demonstrates understanding in writing or other media.

 - Programming / Writing Assignments: ~8 projects, 85 %
   - These projects will focus on implementation, analysis, and documentation of of specific programming concepts.

- Class Participation: 15%
  - Did you show up for required lectures? Did you comment, question, and provide feedback during discussions? Did you actively engage with the material, or do the bare minimum necessary? From time to time, I may also quiz you on the various topics we cover throughout the semester. These will also count toward your partcipation grades.

### Late Work
No late work will be accepted without prior approval, with no exceptions.

If you have an issue with a particular assignment, please contact me in advance to work out a solution.

### Grading

| Percentage |	Grade Point |
| -----------|-------------|
92 - 100% |	4.0
87 - 91%	| 3.5
80 - 86%	| 3.0
75 - 79%	| 2.5
70 - 74%	| 2.0
65 - 69%	| 1.5
60 - 64%	| 1.0
00 - 59%	| 0.0

### Ethics and Academic Integrity
The work you submit must be produced originally for this class. An additional expectation is that you will follow this basic ethical obligation: You should credit others' contributions to your work. You should not claim, as your own, work (or writing) that is not your own. To do so is considered plagiarism. It is perfectly appropriate for you to borrow graphics, to quote passages, and to use ideas from others. However, whenever you do that, follow appropriate conventions for citing and using your sources. Procedures for responding to cases of academic honesty and possible repercussions are outlined in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide. They can also be found on the web at: https://ombud.msu.edu/academic-integrity/

In programming, it is common to find examples and modify them to fit your own needs. But relying entirely on other people's code is not acceptable. The goal here is to understand the concepts that the assignments focus on, not to simply copy and paste something with no idea about what is actually happening. For assignments, you will often have to comment your code in a way that shows that you understand what is happening, not simply that you can copy and paste things to get them to work.

If you have any doubts or want to clarify things, just ask before things are due.

### Student Health and Wellness
Masks are required in all indoor spaces on campus, including our classroom. Per MSU’s “Together We Will” guidelines (https://msu.edu/together-we-will/faqs/),

> "a student who refuses to wear a mask even after being asked is considered a disruptive student and should be asked to leave the classroom. The conduct process for a student who disrupts the class by refusing to wear a mask is the same process that is used for any other disruptive student."

If you test positive for COVID-19, are not feeling well, or if you have been exposed to COVID, please stay home and contact MSU’s COVID-19 hotline at 855-958-2678. If you have questions about how MSU is responding to COVID-19, please refer to https://msu.edu/together-we-will/faqs/

If you will miss class, please alert me immediately. I will keep you up-to-date regarding missed assignments and/or help you to catch up once you are well, have had the requisite number of negative COVID tests, and/or have quarantined for the CDC-required minimum number of days. I am also willing to schedule a catch-up meeting with you online or by phone, when and as you are able.

College students often experience issues that may interfere with academic success such as academic stress, sleep problems, juggling responsibilities, life events, relationship concerns, or feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or depression. If you or a friend is struggling, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Helpful, effective resources are available on campus, and most are free of charge.

Visit https://caps.msu.edu for online health assessments, hours, and additional CAPS services. Call CAPS at (517) 355-8270 any time, day or night. 24-Hour MSU Sexual Assault Crisis Line (517) 372-6666 or visit https://centerforsurvivors.msu.edu/

### Safe Learning Environment
Our class and our university aim to be safe learning environments. Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources here:

- [Bias Incident Reporting](https://liveon.msu.edu/Reporting-Discrimination)
- [MSU's Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Prevention Program](https://endrape.msu.edu/)

### Students with Disabilities
If you have one or multiple disabilities and need particular accommodations, please discuss this with me early in the semester. You must be registered with the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities to receive accommodations. RCPD is in 120 Bessey Hall and may be reached at: (517) 884-RCPD (4-7273) or by visiting: https://www.rcpd.msu.edu/

### Mandatory Reporting of Abuse
Course work submitted for this class is generally considered confidential pursuant to the University's student record policies. However, students should be aware that University employees are required to report suspected child abuse/neglect and allegations of sexual assault to the appropriate campus authorities when they become aware of such matters in the course of their employment. Sexual assault survivors are encouraged to meet with the Sexual Assault Program at the MSU Counseling Center for confidential counseling and advocacy services.
