## Text Editors
Text editors - unlike word processors (like Microsoft Word and Google Docs) - allow you manipulate plain text, the file structure for all HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript files.

They are simply tools to accomplish a particular goal. But there are dozens of options available and people can be passionate or evangelical about their text editor of choice.

Text editors can do simple things like provide line numbering and syntax highlighting (both invaluable in writing code) or be incredibly complex, 
offering features like code completion, automatic deployment to remote servers, built-in debugging tools, and comprehensive project management.

The two most popular free, open source text editors are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (I use Sublime) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) and I'd recommend using one of these.
